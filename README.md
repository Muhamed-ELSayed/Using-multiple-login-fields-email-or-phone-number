How to Implement Multiple login fields via email or phone number

# Code

### Section - Hello World

I was planning to create a simple example, but I ended up enjoying way too much the implementation. So I created something more elaborated (which I might use in future examples). The good thing is that now you have a working example that you can study or re-use some parts of the implementation.

Anyway, this example is using Python 3.8, Django 3.0 and Materialize.

I named the project “Using multiple login fields”, and it’s an application can create the custom user can sign up and sign in via email or phone number.
